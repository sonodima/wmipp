> WMI++ is a tiny-but-mighty header-only C++20 library that takes away the pain of dealing with the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

> If you've ever had the necessity to use WMI, you know it can be like wrestling with a grumpy elephant.
> 
> WMI++ swoops in like a nimble superhero to save the day, providing a clean and intuitive interface for your WMI needs.

## Usage

#### Minimal Example

Retrieve a specific property from a WMI query using WMI++.
The code executes a query that selects the `Name` property from the `Win32_Processor` class.
The result is accessed and stored as a `std::optional<std::string>` in the `value` variable.

```cpp
#include <wmipp/wmipp.hxx>

const auto value = wmipp::Interface()
  .ExecuteQuery(L"SELECT Name FROM Win32_Processor")
  .GetProperty<std::string>(L"Name");
```

#### Custom Path

Connect to a specific WMI namespace by providing a custom path to the `wmipp::Interface` constructor.
Replace `"CUSTOM_PATH_HERE"` with the desired custom path, such as the namespace or machine path.

```cpp
const auto interface = wmipp::Interface("CUSTOM_PATH_HERE");
```

#### Object Iteration

Iterate over multiple WMI objects returned by a query.
The code executes a query that selects the Model property from the `Win32_DiskDrive` class.
The for loop iterates over the resulting objects.
Within the loop, retrieve the `Model` property value of each object using the `GetProperty` function and store it in the `model` variable.

```cpp
for (const auto& obj : wmipp::Interface().ExecuteQuery(L"SELECT Model FROM Win32_DiskDrive")) {
  const auto model = obj.GetProperty<std::string>(L"Model");
}
```

## About Typing

Currently there is support for the majority of the types you would usually need to query.
This is done by building a __variant_t__ and delegating it to handle the conversions.
Furthermore, strings are converted from bstr_ts, and arrays are built from CComSafeArrays.

However, support is currently not guaranteed for all types that can be present in VARIANTs.
